No. 1372. — Let there be a Na replacing na in the latter member of the compound word coming AFTER a ra, R or Sa located in the **prior member**, of the same compound, word, _when_ the word is an _name\_— but NOT if the letter_ ga _comes at the end in the \_PRIOR MEMBER_. Thus zUrpaNakhA "\[the sister of Ravana — viz.\] Surpanakha \[ — whose nails were like winnowing baskets.\]" Then \[as another example of No. 1371 there may be\] gauramukhA "Fair-face." Why \[in No. 1371\] do we say "when a name"? Consider tAmramukhI kanyA "a copper-faced damsel." Here tAmramukhI is the adjective not a name.
