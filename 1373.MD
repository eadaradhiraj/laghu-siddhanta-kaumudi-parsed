No. 1373. — Let the feminine affix be GIS after that which is expressive of a _kind_, and is _not invariably feminine_ — moreover — _not having_ the letfer ya _for its penultimate_ letter. Thus from \[taTaH\] taTI "shore," vRSalI "a woman of the servile tribe;" kaThI "a woman of the class of Brahmans who read, the kaTha section of the Rig Veda; bahvRcI "a woman of the class of Brahmans who read the Rig Veda." Why do we say "expressive of a kind"? See muNDA "shaven" — \[where the word expresses not a kind but a quality — see Saahitya Darpana 12 b. and d.\] Why do we say "not, invariably feminine"? Witness balAkA "a crane" - \[supposed to breed without the male\]. Why do we say "not having the letter ya for its penultimate letter"? See kSatriyA a female kSatriya.
