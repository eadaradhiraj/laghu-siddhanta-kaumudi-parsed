No. 1374 .— "**In the excluding \[from No. 1373\] of words that have letter** ya AS the penultimate, there 13 not involved the **exclusion** **of** \[the following words which have a penultimate ya — viz.-—\] \*\*गवय "\*\*the Bos Gavaeus," haya "a horse," mukaya "a sort of animal," matsya "a fish," and manuSya "a man." Thus gavayI "the female, of the Bos Gavaeus" hayI "a mare," mukayI a female mukaya.

 By No. 1364! there is elision of the ya —the manuSI, "a woman" — and \[according to kaataayana\] there is elision of the ya of matsya (though this word does not end in a taddhitaa affix) when the feminine affix  follows — so that we have matsI "a female, fish."
