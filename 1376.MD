o. 1376.— After a word ending in **u**, not having the letter **y** as its penultimate letter, and being denoting males, the affix in the feminine is **UG**(ending in **U**), Thus **kurUH** "_a female Kuru._” Why do we say “_not having the letter **y** as its penultimate letter_”’ ? See adhvaryuH_ _a woman of the class of Brahmans versed in the Yajur Veda_.
