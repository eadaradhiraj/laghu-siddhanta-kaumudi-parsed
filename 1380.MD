And (Un _(ending in_ U\_)\_ shall be the feminine affix after the word Uru the thigh coming, in a compound,) after the words saMhita “joined.” zapha “a hoof” lakSaNa, “a mark,” AND vAma “handsome,” etc. This aphorism is for the sake of cases where the thigh is not being compared with something else (as there is in the cases to which No. 1379 refers). Thus saMhitorU “ whose thighs are joined \[ — e. g., from obesity\],” zaphorU “ whose thighs are \[put together\] like \[the two\] hoofs \[on a cow’s foot\],” lakSaNorU “ whose thighs are marked,” vAmorU “with handsome thighs."
