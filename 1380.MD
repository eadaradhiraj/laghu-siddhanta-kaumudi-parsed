And (**Un** _(ending in U)_ shall be the feminine affix after the word **Uru** the thigh” coming, in a compound,) after the words **saMhita** “joined.” **zapha** “a hoof” **lakSaNa**, “a mark,” AND **vAma** “handsome,” etc. This aphorism is for the sake of cases where the thigh is not being compared with something else (as there is in the cases to which No. 1379 refers). Thus **saMhitorU** “ whose thighs are joined [ — e. g., from obesity],” **zaphorU** “ whose thighs are [put together] like [the two] hoofs [on a cow’s foot],” **lakSaNorU** “ whose thighs are marked,” **vAmorU** “ with handsome thighs.”
