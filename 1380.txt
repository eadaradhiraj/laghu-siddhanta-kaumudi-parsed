अनौपम्यार्थं सूत्रम्। संहितोरूः। शफोरूः। लक्षणोरूः। वामोरूः। => अन-उपम्य-अर्थम् सूत्रम्। संहितोरूः। शफोरूः। लक्षणोरूः। वामोरूः।

And (ऊन् (ऊ) shall be the feminine affix after the word ऊरु the thigh” coming, in a compound,) after the words संहित “joined.” शफ “a hoof” लक्षण, “a mark,” AND वाम “handsome,” etc. This aphorism is for the sake of cases where the thigh is not being compared with something else (as there is in the cases to which No. 1379 refers). Thus संहितोरू “ whose thighs are joined [ — e. g., from obesity],” शफोरू “ whose thighs are [put together] like [the two] hoofs [on a cow’s foot],” लक्षणोरू “ whose thighs are marked,” वामोरू “ with handsome thighs.”
