No 1381. — Let GIn(ending in I) be the feminine affix AFTER the word zArGgarava etc., and after what ends with the letter a of the affix aJ (No. 1075) when the word speaks of a kind \[not of a wife — No. 1356\]. Thus zArGgaravI "a zArGgarava woman," baidI \[from bida, which, besides ending with the affix aJ, as it happanes in words like zArGgaravI(e.g these words are derived like zRGgarava -> zArGgarava, bida -> baida, etc.) in the list zArGgarava etc," may end with the affix aJ\] "a female descendant of bida," brAhmaNI "a female of the brahmins."
